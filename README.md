# HTML Web Page

This project represents my first stab at creating a webpage. Using matplotlib visualizations from a previous project, I created a site with several different paths showing different charts with correpsonding analysis. I made sure that the navbar and footer were consistent from page to page and the same aesthetic was maintained throughout.

One of the more challenging aspects was getting the UI to scale properly for mobile devices using CSS.
